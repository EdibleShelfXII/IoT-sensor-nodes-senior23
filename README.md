# IoT-sensor-nodes-senior23
Senior project repo belonging to Luis Rivera, Juwan English, and Anthony Lopez

This project is complete for the spring semester 2023 at Kennesaw State University

We are researching Ultra-Low-Power sensor Nodes using the RP2040 and SHT40 as well as IR communications. This project uses the NEC protocol to transmit data rather than commands. 

If you have questions about our implementation of the SHT40 with the raspberry pi pico or our unique NEC data transmission, feel free to reach out to EdibleShelfXII

Requires raspberry pi pico C/C++ SDK
